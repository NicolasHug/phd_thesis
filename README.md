Phd Thesis
==========

This repo contains the latex sources of my PhD thesis that I defended in 2017:

*Contributions to the use of analogical proportions for machine learning:
theoretical properties and application to recommendation.*

My PhD advisors were Henri Prade, Gilles Richard and Mathieu Serrurier.

Use `make` to build the pdf (requires `latexmk`).
