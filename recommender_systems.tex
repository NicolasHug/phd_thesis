\chapter{Recommender systems}

In a world of information overload, automatic filtering tools are essential to
extract relevant information from basic noise. In the field of e-commerce,
recommender systems play the role of search engines when surfing the entire
web: they filter available items to provide relevant suggestions to customers.

With the huge development of online businesses, recommender systems have become
more and more popular \cite{RecoSystemHandbook,AdoTuzIEEE2005}. They help to
answer questions as diverse as ``what movie to rent?", ``what item to buy?" or
``which restaurant to try?", but also such as ``what piece of code to
investigate ?" in the case of recommender system for software development.
They do so by providing the user with a list of recommendations.  Obviously,
the more personalized the recommendations, the better the system.  For
instance, a system recommending only the most popular items is useless as it is
likely that the standard customer knows these items. But the maximization of
business profit may also lead to suggest items which are not very popular (and
thus difficult to sell), provided they may be of interest for the user.

A very common way of providing personalized recommendations to a target user is
to estimate its taste for the items that the system provides. The taste of a user
$u$ for a given item $i$ is usually represented as a rating that $u$ would give
to $i$.  The scale of the ratings may vary, but the integer interval [1, 5] and
the \textit{like}/\textit{dislike} scales are very common in real world
systems.

Once these estimations are made, a simple option is to recommend the items with
the highest ratings among all the estimated scores for the considered user
(using the implicit assumption that a user should be interested in the items
with high scores).

Providing an accurate measure of the overall quality of a recommender system is
not a simple task and diverse viewpoints have to be considered (see
\cite{RecoSystemHandbook} for an extensive survey).  Obviously, accuracy of
its core prediction algorithm is an important matter, but other properties are
also desirable in order  to deploy an effective recommendation engine. For
instance {\it coverage} measuring what is the range of items in the catalogue
that could be recommended, or {\it serendipity} measuring in some sense the
surprise that a user could get when a new item is suggested.

\section{Background on recommender systems}
\label{sec:background_RS}

The aim of a recommendation system is to provide users with lists of relevant
personalized items.  Let us now formalize the problem.

\subsection{Problem formalization and notation}
Let $U$ be a set of users and $I$ a set of items. For some pairs $(u,i) \in U
\times I$, a rating  $\rui$ is supposed to have been given by $u$ to express
whether she likes the item $i$ or not.
It is quite common that  $\rui \in [1, 5]$, 5 meaning a strong preference for
item $i$, 1 meaning a strong rejection, and 3 meaning indifference, or just an
average note.  Let us denote by $R$ the set of ratings recorded in the system. It
is well known that, in real systems, the size of $R$ is very small with regard
to the potential number of ratings which is $|U| \times |I|$, as a lot of
ratings are missing. In the following, $U_i$ denotes the set of users that have
rated item $i$, and $I_u$ is the set of items that
user $u$ has rated.

To recommend items to users, a recommender system will proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using a prediction algorithm $A$, estimate the unknown ratings $\rui$
(i.e. $\rui \notin R$). This estimation $A(u, i)$ is usually denoted
$\predrui$.
\item Using a recommendation strategy $S$ and in the light of the previously
estimated ratings, recommend items to users. For instance, a basic yet
common strategy is to suggest to user $u$ the items $i \notin I_u$ with the
highest $\predrui$.
\end{enumerate}

Traditionnaly, prediction algorithms are considered to belong to one of the two
main families of prediction techniques, refered to as \textbf{content-based}
methods and \textbf{collaborative filtering} methods, that we both review
below. Note that in practice, real world recomender systems usually use a mix
of both methods, and are refered to as \textbf{hybrid} methods.

\subsection{Content-based techniques}
\label{sec:content-based}

Content-based algorithms use the metadata of users and items to estimate a
rating. Metadata are external information that can be collected. Typically:

\begin{itemize}
\item for users: gender, age, occupation, location (zip code), etc.
\item for items: it depends on the type of items, but in the case of movies, it
  could be their genre, main actors, film director, etc.
\end{itemize}

Based on these metadata, a content-based system will try to find items that are
similar to the ones for which the target user has already expressed a
preference (for instance by giving a high rating). This implies the need for a
similarity measure between items. A lot of options are available for such
metrics.
\todo{DÃ©tailler (TF-IDF etc)}

A well-known drawback of content-based techniques is their tendency to
recommend only items that users may already know, and therefore the
recommendations lack in novelty, surprise and diversity. Also, they tend to
output much less accurate prediction the collaborative filtering methods. This
is why recent works have mostly focused on this kind of techniques.

\subsection{Collaborative filtering techniques}
\label{sec:collaborative_filtering}
By collaborative filtering, we mean here algorithms that only rely on the set
of known ratings $R$ to make a prediction: to predict $\rui \notin R$, the
algorithm $A$ will output $\predrui$ based on $R$ or on a carefully chosen
subset.  The main difference between collaborative and content-based method is
that in the former, metadata of items and users are not used, and in the latter
the only ratings we may take into account are that of the target user.

\subsubsection{The neighborhood approach}
\todo{Detail all this}
To estimate the rating of a user $u$ for an item $i$, we select $N_i^k(u)$, the
set of $k$ users that are most similar to $u$ and that have rated $i$. Here
again, there is a need for a similarity measure (between users, and based on
their respective ratings). The estimation of $\rui$ is computed as follows:
$$\predrui = \aggr{v \in N_i^k(u)}r_{vi},$$
where the aggregate function $\aggr{}$ is usually a mean weighted by the
similarity between $u$ and $v$. A more sophisticated prediction, popularized by
\cite{BelKorSIGKDD2007} is as follows:
$$\predrui = b_{ui} + \aggr{v \in N_i^k(u)}(r_{vi} - b_{vi}),$$
where $b_{ui}$ is a baseline (or bias) related to user $u$ and item $i$. It
is supposed to model how $u$ tends to give higher (or lower) ratings than the
average of ratings $\mu$, as well as how $i$ tends to be rated higher or lower
than $\mu$. As it uses the neighbourhood of users to output a prediction, this
technique tends to model local relationships in the data.

Note that it is perfectly possible to proceed in an item-based way. Indeed,
rather than looking for users similar to $u$, one may look for items similar to
$i$, which leads to formulas dual of the above ones.

\subsubsection{Matrix factorization}

\todo{Detail all this}
The matrix factorization approach is heavily inspired by singular value
decomposition (SVD): it postulates the existence of $f$ factors/criterias
(whose nature is not necessarily known) that determine the value of any rating
$\rui$.  A user $u$ is modeled as a vector $p_u \in \mathbb{R}^f$, where each
component of $p_u$ models the importance of the corresponding factor for $u$.
Similarly, an item $i$ is modeled as a vector $q_i \in \mathbb{R}^f$, where
each component of $q_i$ models how well $i$ fits the corresponding criteria.
From then, a rating prediction $\predrui$ is calculated as the dot product
of the two vectors $p_u$ and $q_i$: $$\predrui = p_u^t \cdot q_i$$ For the
interested reader, see the work of
\cite{Funk2006,KorACM2010} The number of factors being set,
the problem is here to estimate the vectors $p_u$ and $q_i$ for every possible
users and items. Two methods are commonly used for this task: alternating least
squares and stochastic gradient descent, first popularized by \cite{Funk2006}.

Contrary to the neighbourhood-based approach, the matrix factorization
technique tends to model global aspects of the data.  Matrix factorization and
neighbourhood based techniques have been successfully mixed in the works of
\cite{KorACM2010}.


\subsection{Recommender system
evaluation}\label{eval} Providing an accurate measure of the overall quality of
a recommender system is not a simple task and diverse viewpoints have to be
considered (see \cite{RecoSystemHandbook} for an extensive survey).
% Obviously
%accuracy is an important matter as  any system includes a prediction algorithm,
%but other properties are also desirable in order  to deploy an effective
%recommendation engine.

\paragraph{Accuracy\\}
The performance of the algorithm $A$ is usually evaluated in terms of accuracy,
which measures how close the rating prediction $\predrui$ is to the true
rating value $\rui$, for every possible prediction. To evaluate the accuracy
of a prediction algorithm, one usually follows the classical machine learning
framework: the set of ratings $R$ is divided into two disjoint sets $\Rtrain$
and $\Rtest$, and the algorithm $A$ has to predict ratings in $\Rtest$
based on the ones belonging to $\Rtrain$.

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is probably the most common indicator of
how accurate an algorithm is, and is calculated as follows:
$$\text{RMSE}(A) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|\Rtest|} \cdot \sum_{\rui \in
\Rtest}(\predrui - \rui)^2}.$$

Another common indicator for accuracy is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), where
important errors are not penalized more than small ones:
$$\text{MAE}(A) = \frac{1}{|\Rtest|} \cdot \sum_{\rui \in \Rtest}|\predrui -
\rui|.$$

In order to have reliable estimates of the accuracy measures, $k$-folds
cross-validation procedures are often used: the set of all ratings $R$ is
devided into $k$ disjoint sets ; at each of the $k$ iterations, $\Rtrain$ is set
to the $k^{\text{th}}$ subset and $\Rtest$ is set as the $k - 1$ remaining
ones. The reported RMSE (or MAE) is then the average of the $k$ measures.

To better reflect the user-system interaction, other precision-oriented metrics
are sometimes used in order to provide a more informed view.
\todo{Mieux parler des critiques faites Ã  RMSE et MAE}

\paragraph{Precision and recall\\}
Precision and recall help measuring the ability of a system to provide
relevant recommendations.
In the following, we denote by $I_{S}$ the set of items that the strategy
$S$ will suggest to the users using the predictions coming from $A$. For
ratings in the interval $[1, 5]$, a simple strategy could be for example to
recommend an item $i$ to user $u$ if the estimation rating $\predrui$ is
greater than $4$.  $$I_S = \{i \in I | \exists u \in U, \predrui \geq
4\}.$$

Let $I_{relev}$ be the set of items that are actually relevant to users (i.e.
the set of items that would have been recommended to users if all the
predictions made by $A$ were exact).
The precision of the system is defined as the fraction of recommended items that
are relevant to the users:
$$\text{Precision} = \frac{|I_{S} \cap I_{relev}|}{|I_{S}|},$$
and the recall as the fraction of recommended items that are relevant to the
users out of all possible relevant items:
$$\text{Recall} = \frac{|I_{S} \cap I_{relev}|}{|I_{relev}|},$$

If accurate predictions are crucial, it is widely agreed that it is
insufficient for deploying an effective recommendation engine. Indeed, still
other dimensions are worth estimating in order to get a complete picture of the
performance of a system
\cite{NeeRieKonACM2006,HerKonJohTerRieACM2004,KamBriRecSys2014}.
For instance, one may naturally expect from a recommender system
not only to be accurate, but also to be surprising, and to be able to recommend
a large number of items. When evaluating the recommendation strategy, one must
keep in mind that its performance is closely related to that of the algorithm
$A$, as the recommendation strategy $S$ is based on the predictions provided by
$A$.


\paragraph{Coverage\\}
Coverage, in its simplest form, is used to measure the ability of a system to
recommend a large amount of items: it is quite easy indeed to create a
recommender system that would only recommend very popular items. Such a
recommender system would drop to zero added value. Coverage can be defined as the
proportion of recommended items out of all existing items:
$$\text{Coverage} = \frac{|I_{S}|}{|I|}.$$



\paragraph{Surprise\\}
Users expect a recommender system to be surprising: recommending an extremely
popular item is not really helpful. Following the works of
\cite{KamBriRecSys2014}, surprise of a recommendation can be evaluated with the
help of the pointwise mutual
information (PMI). The PMI between two items $i$ and $j$ is defined as follows:
$$PMI(i, j) = -\log_2 \frac{p(i, j)}{p(i)p(j)} / \log_2 p(i, j),$$
where $p(i)$ and $p(j)$  represent the probabilities for the items to be rated
by any user, and $p(i, j)$ is the probability for $i$ and $j$ to be rated
together: $p(i) = \tfrac{|U_i|}{|U|}$ and $p(i, j) = \tfrac{|U_i \cup
U_j|}{|U|}$. PMI values fluctuate between the interval $[-1, 1]$, $-1$ meaning
that $i$ and $j$ are never rated together and $1$ meaning that they are always
rated together. To estimate the surprise of recommending an item $i$ to a user
$u$ we have two choices:
\begin{itemize}
\item either to take the maximum of the PMI values for $i$ and all
other items rated by $u$, with $Surp^{max}(u, i) = \max\limits_{j\in I_u} PMI(i, j)$
\item
 or to take the mean of these PMI values with $Surp^{avg}(u, i) =
\frac{\sum_{j \in I_u} PMI(i, j)}{|I_u|}$
\end{itemize}
Then the overall capacity of a recommender to surprise its users is the mean of the
surprise values for all predictions.

\section{Analogical recommendation}
\label{sec:analogical_recommendation}

The main idea is that if an analogical proportion stands between four
users $a, b, c, d$, meaning that for each item $j$ that they have commonly
rated, the analogical proportion $r_{aj} : r_{bj} :: r_{cj} : r_{dj}$ holds,
then it should also hold for an item $i$ that $a, b, c$ have rated but $d$ has
not (i.e. $r_{di}$ is the missing component). This leads us to estimate
$r_{di}$ as the solution $x = \hat{r}_{di}$ of the following analogical equation:
$$r_{ai} : r_{bi} :: r_{ci} : x.$$
\noindent
Given a pair $(u,i)$ such that $r_{ui} \notin R$, the main procedure is as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item find the set of 3-tuples of users $a, b, c$ such that an analogical proportion
stands between $a, b, c,$ and $u$ and such that the equation $r_{ai} : r_{bi} :: r_{ci} : x$
is solvable.
\item solve the equation $r_{ai} : r_{bi} :: r_{ci} : x$ and consider the solution
$x$ as a candidate rating for $r_{ui}$.
\item set $\hat{r}_{ui}$ as an aggregate of all candidate ratings.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{An algorithm using arithmetic proportion}
In the following, let $I_{abcu}$ be the set of items $i$ that users $a, b, c,$
and $u$ have commonly rated: $r_{ai} \in R, r_{bi} \in R, r_{ci} \in R$ and
$r_{ui}\in R$.
The first step simply states that users $a, b, c$ and $u$, considered as
vectors of ratings, constitute a parallelogram.  This condition is a bit strong
and we may want to relax it by allowing some deformation of this parallelogram.
This can be done by choosing another condition, such as $||(a-b) - (c-d)|| \leq
\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is a suitable threshold and $||.||$ denotes the
Euclidean norm.

Another modification to the algorithm would be to only search for the users
$a, b,$ and $c$ in a subset of $U$. One may consider the set of the $k$-nearest
neighbours of $d$, using the assumption that neighbours are the most relevant
users to estimate a recommendation for $d$.

Obviously, analogical proportion may be applied in an item-based way rather
than in a user-based way, as in the case of standard techniques. Both views
will be considered in the experimentation.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

In our implementation, we consider the basic definition of analogy using the
arithmetic definition in $\mathbb{R}^n$: $\vec{a}:\vec{b}::\vec{c}:\vec{d}
\iff \vec{a}-\vec{b}=\vec{c}-\vec{d}$.
Given 4 users, they are represented as real vectors of dimension $m$, where $m$
is the number of item they have rated in common. This dimension can
change with the 4-tuples of users that we consider. 
Then, the threshold $\lambda$ has to be a function of this dimension $m$,
as the range of values that $||.||$ may take depends on it. Using
cross-validation, we have found that $\lambda = \frac{3}{2} \cdot\sqrt{m}$ showed the
best results and acts as a kind of normalization factor.
Our pseudo-code is described in
Algorithm \ref{algo:analogical_reco}.
 \begin{algorithm}[!ht]
     \caption{Analogy}
       \label{algo:analogical_reco}
       \begin{algorithmic}

      \STATE {\bf Input}: A set of known ratings $R$, a user $u$, an item
      $i$ such that $r_{ui} \notin R$.
      \STATE {\bf Output}: $\hat{r}_{ui}$, an estimation of $r_{ui}$

      \STATE {\bf Init}:
      \STATE $C = \varnothing$ \quad \quad // list of candidate ratings
      \FORALL{
        users $a, b, c$ such that\\ 
        \begin{enumerate} 
        \item $r_{ai} \in R, r_{bi} \in R, r_{ci} \in R$
        \item $r_{ai} - r_{bi} = r_{ci} - x$ is solvable  // i.e. the solution $x \in [1,5]$
        \item $||(a-b)-(c-d)||\leq \lambda$ // Analogy almost stands between $a,b,c,d$ considered as real vectors
        \end{enumerate}
      }
      
      \STATE  $x \leftarrow r_{ci} - r_{ai} + r_{bi}$
      \STATE $C \gets C \cup \{x\}$ \quad // add x as a candidate rating
	  \ENDFOR

    \STATE $\hat{r}_{ui} = \aggr{x \in C} x$

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Some options are available at this stage. 

Here again, there is no need to choose the Euclidean norm (i.e. $L_2$ norm) as
other norms also make sense: $L_1$ norm using the absolute value of the
components or even $L_\infty$ using the maximum of the absolute value of the
components. These options have not been tested so far.

We have considered a strict condition for the solvability of the equation
$r_{ai} - r_{bi} = r_{ci} - x$: as the exact arithmetic result $x=r_{ci} +
r_{bi} -r_{ai}$ does not necessarily belong to the scale interval $[1,5]$, we
consider solvability only when $r_{ai}=r_{bi}$ or $r_{ai}=r_{ci}$. In both
cases, we ensure the solution $x \in [1,5]$.

\subsection{Experiments and results}
\label{results}

Our algorithm \textit{Analogy} ($k=20$) is compared to the neighbourhood-based algorithms
described in section \ref{CollabFil}, referred to as \textit{kNN} for the basic
model and \textit{Bsln-kNN} for the extended model using a baseline predictor
(with $k=40$). For each of the algorithms, we have estimated the metrics described
in section \ref{eval}. The recommendation strategy $S$ is to recommend $i$ to
$u$ if $\hat{r}_{ui} \geq 4$.

\paragraph{Dataset\\}
We have tested and compared our algorithm on the Movielens-100K
dataset\footnote{http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/}, composed of 100,000
ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies. Each rating belongs to the interval
$[1, 5]$.

\paragraph{Evaluation protocol\\}
In order to obtain meaningful measures, we have run a five-folds
cross-validation procedure: for each of the five steps, the set of ratings $R$ is
split into two disjoint sets $R_{train}$ and $R_{test}$, $R_{train}$ containing
five times more ratings than $R_{test}$. The reported measures are averaged
over the five steps.

\paragraph{Results and comments\\}

Table \ref{table:res} shows the performances of the algorithms applied in a
user-based way. Similar experiments have been led in a movie-based setting, exhibiting
very similar results, slightly worse for RMSE (about 5\permil higher).

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{Performance of algorithms}
\label{table:res}
\begin{tabular}{| c || c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
\hline
& RMSE & Prec & Rec & Cov & $Surp^{max}$ & $Surp^{avg}$ & Time \\
\hline
Analogy   & .898 & 89.1 & 43.3 & 31.2 & 0.433 & 0.199 & 2h \\
%Pattern & .927 & 84.9 & 50.0 & 47.7 & 0.433 & 0.198 & 5h \\
kNN     & .894 & 89.1 & 44.1 & 27.8 & 0.432 & 0.198 & 10s \\
Bsln-kNN & .865 & 88.4 & 44.0 & 44.7 & 0.431 & 0.199 & 10s \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

As expected, the Bsln-kNN algorithm is more accurate than the basic
collaborative filtering method (KNN). The two classical collaborative
algorithms perform better than the new proposed analogy-based method in terms
of RMSE. Still, there seems to be some room for improvement for the analogical
approach, with the help of a careful analysis of the behaviour of the
algorithm.

As for performances other than RMSE, we see that the figures obtained by the
three algorithms are quite close. Regarding surprise, which is a delicate
notion to grasp, one may also wonder if the used measure is fully appropriate.

As usual, analogy-based algorithms suffer from their inherent cubic complexity.
In the case of recommender systems where millions of users/items are involved,
this is also a serious issue. 

\section{Clones}

Considering analogy between four users has shown to be computationally
intensive, thus not really suitable for recommendation purposes, where time is
a highly critical dimension. Yet, other forms of analogy can be addressed in
the recommendation task, based on the observation that some users may be more
inclined to give good (or bad) ratings than others. Indeed, ratings are in no
way absolute and greatly depend on the subjective appreciation each user has
about the rating scale. In the $[1, 5]$ scale for example, two users $u$ and
$v$ might semantically agree on an item $i$ describing it as $bad$, but there
is a chance that this agreement is not perfectly reflected in the ratings: $u$
might have rated $i$ with $r_{ui} = 1$ and $v$ with $r_{vi} = 3$, simply
because from $v$' point of view $3$ is a \textit{bad} rating, while for $u$ a
rating of $3$ would simply mean \textit{decent} or \textit{good enough}.  In
the following, we refer such users that \textit{semantically} agree on their
common items (but not necessarily \textit{numerically}) as \textit{clones}, as
illustrated in Figure \ref{FIG_CLONES}. Please note that the word $clone$ is
not used here to mean \textit{strictly identical}, but more in the sense that
two clones are two users following parallel paths.

\todo{use nicer colors for plot?}
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/clones.pdf}
\caption{Bob is a perfect clone of Alice.}
\label{FIG_CLONES}
\end{figure}

It is obvious that in collaborative filtering, clones are of great interest when
it comes to predict a user's ratings, and yet the information they provide is
often discarded.  The principle underlying the analogical clone-based view is
the following: for predicting a missing rating for $u$ we not only look at its
nearest neighbors, but also to those $v$ whose rating are such that $r_{ui} =
r_{vi} + t_{vu}$ where $t_{vu}$ is a more or less constant \textit{correction
term} that can be either positive or negative.

In the next two sections, we investigate this idea of a clone-based prediction,
first when ratings are viewed as numerical quantities in section
\ref{NUMERICAL_POV}, and then when they have an ordinal meaning only in
section \ref{ORDINAL_POV}.

\subsection{Ratings as numerical quantities}
\label{NUMERICAL_POV}

In the following, we define $C_i(u)$ as the set of users that are clones of $u$
and that have rated item $i$.  From the previous definitions, one can easily
derive a very general collaborative filtering framework for predicting a user's
rating by taking into account its clones:
$$\predrui = \text{aggregation}(r_{vi} + t_{vu}), \quad \forall v \in
C_i(u),$$
where $t_{vu}$ is a \textit{correction term} that we need to add to $v$'s
ratings so that they correspond to those of $u$. We clearly have a
generalization of the $k$-NN approach, which we could write as:
$$\predrui = \text{aggregation}(r_{vi} + t_{vu}), \quad \forall v \in \{v \in C_i(u)
  | t_{vu} = 0\}.$$

Following this general framework, one can construct a great variety of
algorithms with various level of complexity. In the next subsections, we
propose a very straightforward algorithm, and a more efficient one.

\subsubsection{A straightforward prediction algorithm}
\label{STRAIGHTFORWARD}

In its most simple form, a user $v$ can be considered to be a $t$-clone of $u$ if
the ratings of $v$ differ from those of $u$ from a constant $t$:
\begin{equation}
v \in t\text{-}C(u) \iff \forall i \in I_{uv}, r_{ui} = r_{vi} + t.
\end{equation}
From then on, computing $\predrui$ amounts to finding all the users $v$ that
satisfy this criteria, and computing an aggregation of their rating for $i$,
which can simply be a mean. We implemented this basic algorithm described by
algorithm \ref{algo_straight}, and referred to as \textit{Bruteforce}.

 \begin{algorithm}[!ht]
   \caption{\textit{Bruteforce}}
       \label{algo_straight}
       \begin{algorithmic}

      \STATE {\bf Input}: A set of known ratings $R$, a user $u$, an item
      $i$ such that $r_{ui} \notin R$.
      \STATE {\bf Output}: $\hat{r}_{ui}$, an estimation of $r_{ui}$

      \STATE {\bf Init}:
      \STATE $C = \varnothing$ \quad \quad // list of candidate ratings
      \FORALL{ users $v \in U_i$}
        \FORALL{$t$}
          \IF{$v \in t\text{-Clones}(u)$}
          \STATE $C \gets C \cup \{r_{vi} + t\}$ \quad // add x as a candidate rating
          \ENDIF
        \ENDFOR
	    \ENDFOR
    \STATE $\hat{r}_{ui} = \aggr{x \in C} x$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Of course, one may want to relax the definition of a $t$-clone, as the current
one is too strict and only very few users will satisfy this criteria. In our
implementation, we chose the following condition:
$$v \in t\text{-}C(u) \iff \sum_{i \in I_{uv}} |(r_{ui} - r_{vi}) - t| \leq |I_{uv}|.$$
This amounts to accept $v$ as a $t$-clone of $u$ if on average, $r_{ui} -
r_{vi}$ is equal to $t$ with a margin of $1$.

The values of $t$ clearly depend on the rating scale. The dataset on which we
tested our algorithms use the $[1, 5]$ interval, so possible values for $t$
that were considered are integer values between $[-4, 4]$.

This is obviously a very rough algorithm, to which one could point out numerous
flaws, but its purpose is to show that even such a basic clone-based approach
can lead to better results than a basic neighborhood method.

\subsubsection{Modeling clones with the similarity measure}
\label{MODELING_CLONES}
Another option to consider clones is to use the well known neighborhood-based
formula, and capture their effect inside an appropriate similarity measure. The
general neighborhood formula is as follows \cite{RecoSystemHandbook}:

$$\predrui = \frac{\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)} r_{vi} \cdot sim(u, v)}{\sum_{v \in
  N_i^k(u)} sim(u, v)},$$
where $N_i^k(u)$ is the set of the $k$ nearest neighbors of $u$ that have rated
$i$. So, we move from a crisp view of the set of clones to a fuzzy one. In
fact, the above formula looks very similar to the interpolation principle
underlying Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller where similarity degree is viewed as
a fuzzy membership grade \cite{TakSug85}.

The above formula is commonly used with classical similarity metrics such as
Pearson or cosine similarity, or inverse of MSD (Mean Squared Difference, which is
a distance).
However, these similarities are not plainly satisfactory when it comes to
clones. Indeed with these metrics, two users are considered to be close if
their common ratings are often the same, but two perfect clones $u$ and $v$
with a significant correction term $t_{vu}$ would be considered as far from
each other, thus involving a loss of information.

A simple choice to measure how two users relate as clones can be the following:
$$Clone\_dist(u, v) =  \frac{1}{|I_{uv}|} \cdot \sum\limits_{i \in I_{uv}}
((r_{ui} - r_{vi}) - \mu_{uv})^2$$
where $\mu_{vu}$ is the mean difference between ratings of $u$ and $v$:
$$\mu_{uv}= \frac{1}{|I_{uv}|}\sum_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{ui} - r_{vi}).$$

One can understand this distance in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item it can be regarded as the variance of the difference of ratings between
  $u$ and $v$,
\item or it can be regarded as a simple MSD measure ($\text{MSD}(u, v) =
  \frac{1}{|I_{uv}|} \cdot \sum\limits_{i \in I_{uv}}
  (r_{ui} - r_{vi})^2$)
 to which the mean difference of ratings between $u$ and $v$ has been
 subtracted.
  \end{itemize}

As our measure $Clone\_dist$ is a distance, it is necessary to transform it
into a similarity measure. Common choice is to take its inverse (while accounting for zero division): $Clone\_sim(u,
v) = \frac{1}{Clone\_dist(u, v) + 1}$.

Once we know how to find the clones of a user, it is a simple matter to output
a prediction using the classical neighborhood approach:
$$\predrui = \frac{\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)} (r_{vi} + \mu_{uv}) \cdot sim\_clone(u,
v)}{\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)} sim\_clone(u, v)}.$$

This algorithm will be referred to as $CloneA$. For the sake of completeness,
we also tried the same formula but with a more basic similarity metric that
does not care about clones: MSD. This algorithm is referred to as $CloneB$.

\subsubsection{Current practices in neighborhood-based methods}

A simple and efficient formula using neighborhood technique, popularized by
\cite{KorACM2010} is the following:
$$\predrui = b_{ui} + \frac{\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)} (r_{vi} - b_{vi}) \cdot
sim(u, v)} {\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)}sim(u, v)}.$$
It is based on a simple $k$-NN approach, where are added the $b_{ui}$ terms,
called \textit{baselines}: $b_{ui} = \mu + b_u + b_i$. $\mu$ is the global mean
of all ratings in $R$. The $b_u$ term is intended to capture users propensity
to give ratings higher or lower than the global mean $\mu$, and the same goes
for items with $b_i$: some items tend to be rated higher than others. Baselines
are computed by solving a least squares problem:
$$ \min\limits_{b_u, b_i} \sum_{r_{ui} \in R} (r_{ui} - (\mu + b_u + b_i))^2,$$
which can be achieved efficiently by stochastic gradient descent, or
alternating least squares.

Among recommended similarity metrics, this one is of particular interest:
$$\text{sim}(u, v) = \frac
{ \sum\limits_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{ui} -  b_{ui}) \cdot (r_{vi} - b_{vi})}
{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{ui} -  b_{ui})^2} \cdot
\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i \in I_{uv}} (r_{vi} -  b_{vi})^2}}.$$

It is simply a Pearson correlation coefficient, except that instead of
centering ratings by their means, they are centered with the baseline
predictors. An intuitive and illuminating way to look at this algorithm as a
whole is to see that it conceptually follows these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute $R'$, the set of all ratings normalized by the corresponding
    baseline: $r'_{ui} = r_{ui} - b_{ui}$.  $R'$ can be regarded as the set
    where all ratings are given from the same frame of reference, thus
    discarding any bias.  In $R'$, ratings can then be considered as absolute.
  \item Using $R'$, compute similarities between users using the cosine similarity (the
    cosine similarity is the same as the Pearson correlation coefficient,
    except that quantities are not centered).
  \item Output a prediction using the basic $k$-NN formula. As this prediction
    belongs to the same space of $R'$ where ratings have no bias, it needs to
    be transposed back to the space of $R$ (for performance evaluation
    purposes).
\end{enumerate}

In what follows, this algorithm is referred to as $k$-NNbsl.

It is very clear that the use of the baseline predictors is motivated by the
same reasons one would want to consider clones in a rating prediction
algorithms. This means that $k$-NNbsl implicitly takes the idea of clones into account, and thus a form of analogical reasoning.
Differences and resemblances of these two approaches are discussed
in the next section.

\subsubsection{Experiments and discussion}
\label{expeDiscuss}

We evaluated the performance of the aforementioned algorithms in terms of MAE
and RMSE on two datasets, the movielens-100K and movielens-1M
datasets\footnote{http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens}, containing
$100,000$ and $1M$ ratings respectively. Results are shown in tables
\ref{table:res100k} and \ref{table:res1M} and where calculated using 5-folds
cross-validation. For each of these algorithms, the number of neighbors or
clones used to output a prediction is $k = 40$, except for the bruteforce
algorithm where the number of clones can not be controlled.

\end{table}

It is very clear that even a very straightforward approach of the clone-based
recommendation principle significantly outperforms the most basic $k$-NN
algorithm. It is however a lot heavier to compute, thus not very suitable for
real world recommendation purposes (its performances on the Movielens-1M
dataset simply could not be computed). The two other clone-based algorithms
however, have the exact same complexity of any $k$-NN-based algorithm which is
a significant improvement from the algorithm described in section
\ref{ANALOGY_USERS}.

Surprisingly enough, out of the two Clone algorithms, it is the one that does
not care about clones in its similarity measure that achieves the best results.
This might be due to the fact that in the neighborhood based on MSD, $\mu_{uv}$
is necessarily small and thus easier to estimate in a statistical significant
way.

Performances of the Clone algorithms are close to those of the state of the
art $k$-NNbsl algorithm. It is however important to understand that these
algorithms differ on the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Clone algorithms do not address item bias, which is a significant
  drawback. It may not be unreasonable to believe that incorporating item bias
  in the prediction would lead to better results.
\item There is a subtle yet meaningful difference of interpretation between the
  biases induced by both algorithms. In the clone algorithm, biases are all
  pairwise, meaning that they involve two users, and they are computed on items
  that both users have rated. As for the $k$-NNbsl algorithm, there is no such
  thing as a pairwise bias. Bias for a given user is computed using only its
  own ratings, and is a result of a global optimization problem involving the
  global mean of all ratings, which means that every single rating in $R$ has
  an impact on the bias.
\item On the biggest dataset (Movielens-1M), the $k$-NNbsl algorithm appears to
  achieve better accuracy than the other algorithms, while this is not the case
  for the small dataset. A possible explanation is that as baselines are
  computed on the whole training set, they tend to capture most of the noise
  when the training set gets bigger, thus improving accuracy compared to more
  heuristic-based approach.
\end{itemize}

It should also be noted that in fact, it is recommended to perform a shrinkage
on the similarity measure of algorithm $k$-NNbsl, in order to take into account
the number of common items between two users: the more items they share, the
more confident we are when computing their similarity \cite{KorACM2010}. Such
an approach can improve significantly both RMSE and MAE of the algorithm.
Similarly, in the clone-based approach, it might be of interest to discount
clones that rely on a too small number of common items.

\section{Towards an ordinal view of ratings}
\label{ORDINAL_POV}

We may wonder if one can devise a counterpart of the numerical clone-based
approach, which would be compatible with an ordinal view of the ratings.
Indeed, an extreme way for unbiasing and comparing two sets of ratings is to
forget about their numerical values, and only consider their rankings.  The
idea of viewing ratings in a ordinal manner has been advocated in
\cite{KorenOrdRec}.
In this section, we discuss an ordinal counterpart of the analogical approach
previously presented.  Analogical reasoning with ordinal data has first been
proposed in \cite{MicletBarbot09}, yet with a different concern.

\subsection{An algorithm for rank prediction}
Indeed the idea that ``\textit{the rating of user $u$ for item $i$ is to the
rating of user $v$ for item $i$ as the rating of user $u$ for item $j$ is to
the rating of user $v$ for item $j$}ââ may be understood  as well in an ordinal
manner. This leads to state that ``\textit{the relative ranking of item $i$
  among the ratings given by user $u$  is to the relative ranking of item $i$
  among the ratings given by user $v$ as the relative ranking of item $j$ among
  the ratings given by user $u$  is to the relative ranking of item $j$ among
the ratings given by user $v$}.

This means that we need to compare the rankings given by two users $u$ and $v$
on their common items. In the following, $\rho_{ui}$ denotes the relative
ranking of item $i$ out of all the items rated by $u$. Our goal is to estimate
all values of $\rho_{ui}$, for any user and any item. The main steps of a
possible algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute similarities between users, based on their rankings. A very
    popular similarity ranking measure is the Spearman's rank correlation
    coefficient, or Spearman's rho.
  \item Compute an estimated rank $\hat{\rho}_{ui}$ as an aggregation of all the
    rankings $\rho_{vi}$ extracted from the $k$ nearest neighbors (using
    Spearman's rho as similarity):
    $$\hat{\rho}_{ui} = \frac{\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)} \rho_{vi} \cdot
    sim(u, v)}{\sum_{v \in N_i^k(u)} sim(u, v)}.$$
\end{enumerate}

This is obviously very similar to the neighborhood approach described in
section \ref{MODELING_CLONES}, but instead of predicting a rating, we output a
predicted rank. This approach is denoted as \textit{RankAnlg}.


\subsection{Experiments}

We evaluated the performance of our algorithm and compared it to other
previously described approaches, using the exact same evaluation protocol as in
section \ref{expeDiscuss}. The Movielens-1m dataset was not benchmarked, as our
algorithm is too computationally intensive.

RMSE and MAE are good measure for evaluation rating prediction accuracy, but
are not suitable when it comes to evaluate rankings. A better measure is the
Fraction of Concordant Pair, which evaluates the probability that given any two
items $i$ and $j$ rated by any user $u$, the system has correctly estimated
whether $u$ prefers $i$ over $j$ or the inverse. To compute the FCP, we need to
intermediate measures. $c_u$ defines the number of concordant pairs for user
$u$, and $d_u$ its number of discordant pairs. The FCP is then computed over all
users as the proportion of concordant pairs.

\begin{align*}
&c_u = \{(i, j) \in I^2 \quad s.t. \quad \predrui > \predruj \text{ and }
r_{ui} > r_{uj}\}\\
&d_u = \{(i, j) \in I^2 \quad s.t. \quad \predrui \geq \predruj \text{ and }
r_{ui} < r_{uj}\}\\
&FCP = \frac{\sum\limits_{u \in U} c_u}{\sum\limits_{u \in U} c_u + \sum\limits_{u \in U} d_u}
\end{align*}
Note that $\predrui$ here may represent either a rating prediction or a
ranking prediction $\hat{\rho_{ui}}$.

Results are reported in table \ref{table:res100kRank}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{Performance of algorithms on the Movielens-100k dataset (ranking
evaluation)}
\label{table:res100kRank}
\begin{tabular}{| c || c | c | c |}
\toprule
     & RankAnlg &  k-NN & $k$-NNbsl\\
\midrule
FCP  &  .7063   & .7096 &  .7163   \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unfortunately, even a basic algorithm that was not designed for ranking
prediction performs better in terms of FCP. To explain this difference, one may
look at the distribution of average support over all the predictions, as shown
on figure \ref{FIG_SUPPORT}. Between
two users $u$ and $v$, the support is defined as the number of common items
($|I_{uv}|$), which was used to compute the similarity between $u$ and $v$. For
a given prediction $\predrui$, the average support is the average of all the
supports $|I_{uv}|$ over all users $v \in N_i^k(u)$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/support.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of average support.}
\label{FIG_SUPPORT}
\end{figure}

The use Spearman's rho tends to provide with neighbors that have smaller
support, thus leading to a less significant and less accurate estimation of the
neighborhood, which may explain the differences in performance.
